    "text": "Hey there,\nI’m Johic,\nI grew up in Ottawa and chose to pursue a Bachelor’s in Computer Engineering at uOttawa. What no one told me was how domain-agnostic that field could truly be. I never would have guessed that it could open doors that would take me all the way to Iceland to work with prosthetics, into the cutting-edge world of high-tech hardware design, or even to the Public Health Agency of Canada in the midst of a pandemic. I quickly discovered that no matter what realm of work I was in, the goal was always to answer a question or solve a problem. What I had never asked myself was, what kind of problems do I want to solve? Enter the MGEM at UBC, a program where my love for the outdoors, maps, and tech finally unite to answer real, tangible environmental questions. I look forward to deepening my knowledge of geospatial sciences and leveraging my programming skills to refocus my career in the realm of environmental conservation or restoration. Like the kids say these days, my current career never lets me “touch grass”. I’m on a mission to change that. Outside of the academic and professional world, you can probably find me restoring 70s or 80s audio gear while jamming to some music, out on a hike, playing basketball, or trying something new!"

    "text": "This is a sample page where you can archive project deliverables. Every header you use will correspond to a tab in the legend - shown on the right-hand side of your screen (“On this page”).\nIf you’ve produced any GIS layers for your 599 project, this may be a good place to share them as interactive maps through leaflet. Alternatively, you can upload high-res figures showing correlations, box-plots, etc. from your report here, and provide a brief overview of key project results. If you have written some useful functions, you may also want to share those here to demonstrate proficiency in particular coding languages or synergies between notable coding packages.\n\n\nSample leaflet - for detailed leaflet instructions, visit the FCOR 599 workshop archive page here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample code snippet. Notice that you can provide a toggle to switch between coding languages - this is referred to as a ‘tabset’ in quarto. It is good practice to try and convert your R code to python, and vice-versa to demonstrate coding proficiency. For example, let’s showcase a function for calculating NDVI in R and Python.\n\nRPython\n\n\ncalc_ndvi &lt;- function(nir, red){ ndvi &lt;- (nir-red)/(nir+red) return(ndvi) }\n\n\ndef calc_ndvi(nir, red): \n  ndvi = (nir.astype(float)-red.astype(float))/(nir.astype(float)+red.astype(float))\n  return(ndvi)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also provide a frame linking to external websites. For example, here is a link to a Google Earth Engine application I developed. The full-screen GEE application is available here in case you’re interested.\n(To use the GEE tool, navigate to any city you’d like, hit apply filters, and click anywhere on the map to retrieve a time-series of Landsat surface temperature observations for that point. Areas where the maximum temp exceeded 35 degrees Celsius in your date-range are highlighted in red.)"
